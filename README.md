## !UPDATE
Hi, I thank those that have showed interest in this project. However, as you can tell by the activity I am not working on this project anymore. I found that the documentation for M5stack devices is lacking. Getting the device to connect to your computer and upload code to it proved buggy. I am therefore no longer interested in developping for this platform. This repository is thus more for those who have a working connection to the device and know how to interface with it. The codes here are provided as is, and are not developped any further (for now).

# M5Stack HomeControl
Control your home with a M5Stack and Home Assistant!

I developed a program to control the smart devices in your home.

For this to work you will need Home Assistant running together with the MQTT integration. 

More information and a how-to guide coming soon!
